    Join our Front of House Team and get in on all the hilarious action. You’ll be the first point of contact with our lovely audiences so good communication skills and a friendly attitude are a must. Working with the Front of House Manager you’ll be responsible for getting our audiences to the right place at the right time, making sure the shows run on time and keeping the venues running smoothly. You should be confident, good with people, alert and interested in the programme and event you’re representing. This role is very active and a lot of fun, you should enjoy dealing with lots of people and manage all this with a level head.

    This is a volunteer role, you will be given one scrumptious hot meal per shift and as many (non-alcoholic) drinks as you need.

    You will be expected to work at least three shifts (approx. four hours with breaks) throughout the Comedy Garden, with full availability from 14th June to 18th June regarded very highly. You must be over 16 to apply.

    If you’re interested, please [email](mailto:hannah@57Festivals.com)  and we will be in touch with you shortly.
