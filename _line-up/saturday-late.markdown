The Lidl Enya, Broken Bublé, Comedy Garden favourite David O’Doherty brings the goods time and time again with his unrivalled silly charm (and crappy keyboard). A perpetual award winner in his own right and touring companion of Flight of the Conchords, this Irish legend is good times guaranteed and should not be missed.
