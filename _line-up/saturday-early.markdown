quote: O’Doherty expertly steers his way between the quirky, novelty and off-beat as well as excellent traditional-style stand-up

David O’Doherty, the Lidl Enya, the broken Bublé, headlines the Big Top with talking and songs played on a stupid keyboard from 1986. The 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown regular and Greenwich Comedy Festival favourite never fails to fall short of stupendous.
