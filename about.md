The mighty Bristol Comedy Garden returns this June with a prize-winning crop of comedians. Once again the leafy lawns of [Queen Square](/location/), in the heart of the city, will be transformed into a comedy wonderland complete with outrageously good line-ups in our beautiful Big Top.

Come and satisfy your comic cravings with comedy’s greatest marvel [Ross Noble](/line-up/thursday/), the toweringly tall, toweringly funny, award-winning treasure [Greg Davies](/line-up/sunday-late/), the hugely popular and rampantly spontaneous Last Leg host [Adam Hills](/line-up/sunday-mid/), British Comedy Award-winning genius [Nina Conti](/line-up/saturday-mid/) plus lots more blistering comedy from [Rich Hall](/line-up/saturday-late/), [Sara Pascoe](/line-up/friday/), [David O'Doherty](/line-up/friday/), [Mark Watson](/line-up/wednesday/), [Kerry Godliman](/line-up/saturday-late/), [Stewart Francis](/line-up/saturday-late/), [Tim Key](/line-up/saturday-late/) and many many more.

The South West’s brightest comedy festival will be bursting with bars, gourmet street-food and a whole lot of good-times besides. Get your tickets now and arrive early to make the most of this year’s blooming brilliant Bristol Comedy Garden!

Bristol Comedy Garden is produced by [57 Festivals](http://www.57festivals.com).
