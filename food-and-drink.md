  description: The amazing William Bacon has consolidated 15 years experience as a
    chef, with 7 of those years spent travelling the world, into founding Kurbside
    Kitchen, a wonderful food truck specialising in German frankfurters with gourmet
    toppings, low and slow cooked meats, Cajun and sweet potato fries and super-food
    salads. William is particularly proud of Kurbside’s quite frankly ridiculously
    delicious gourmet hot dogs. They’re made with high quality beef, pork, chorizo
    or tofu with natural skin to ensure the perfect snap and are served inside a brioche
    sub, baked daily by their local artisan baker.

  description: The 3 Little Pigs Souvlaki philosophy is to use time honoured cooking
    methods, family recipes and quality produce to make real food with integrity and
    taste – something that is missing from the Greek/London street food scene. With
    25 years’ experience in the customer service and food-service management industry,
    the time is right to introduce London to The 3 Little Pigs and allow it to experience
    a tradition that has combined an amazing childhood memory, traditional cooking
    techniques and a love of BBQ.

  description: When Alejandro Sepulveda Parra started planning his street food stall,
    he knew exactly where to source his inspiration from. The traditional gua bao,
    also known as steamed bao, a popular Taiwanese street food. Inspired by the huge
    variety of Taiwanese traditions and flavours and combined with Alejandro’s love
    for steamed bao buns, You Bao was created.

  description: 'The Good Slice is a social enterprise with a simple idea: take a slice,
    give a slice. They combine a passion for fine, honest food with a desire to create
    a lasting difference in food insecure communities around the world, from Malawi
    to London. Via a one for one model, for every pizza they sell, they provide a
    meal to someone in need. In 2018 they provided 5,000 meals to the children of
    Well Wishes Nursery, in Northern Malawi. Closer to home, they have partnered with
    Glassdoor - London''s largest open-access support services network for men and
    women affected by homelessness.'
